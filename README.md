# Mapping_Earthquakes_with_JS-API
Module 13


In this project, we added a map style as an additional title layer. Moreover, We added tectonic plate GeoJSON data to the map to illustrate the relationship between the location and frequency of seismic activity and tectnoic plates. All map styles were added to the base layer so that they showed up on the map to allow the user to change which layers are visible.
